# Slate Track Changes

This is a plugin for Slate that adds "track changes" functionality to a Slate editor. It was originally developed internally at [Scripta](https://www.getscripta.com/).

Currently, the functionality is a best-attempt to emulate the "track changes" functionality of Microsoft Word.
